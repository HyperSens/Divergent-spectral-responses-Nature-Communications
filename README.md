Sacristán for their strong support during the field campaigns. We are also grateful for the information provided by the Plant Health Service of the General Directorate of Agriculture of the region of Valencia (Spain) and the Agricultural Service of the General Directorate of Agriculture, Livestock and Rural development of the Balearic Islands (Spain) on the phytosanitary status of almond orchards in the affected area of Alicante and Majorca, respectively, and to TRAGSATEC (Grupo TRAGSA) for their support during the field campaign in Alicante. The study was partially funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through grant agreements POnTE (635646) and XF-ACTORS (727987), as well as by projects AGL2009-13105 from the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science, P08-AGR-03528 from the Regional Government of Andalusia and the European Social Fund, project E-RTA2017-00004-02 from ‘Programa Estatal de I+D+I Orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad’ of Spain and FEDER, Intramural Project 201840E111 from CSIC, and Project ITS2017-095 Consejeria de Medio Ambiente, Agricultura y Pesca de las Islas Baleares, Spain.
